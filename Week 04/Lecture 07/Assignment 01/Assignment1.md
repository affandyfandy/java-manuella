## Assignment 01: Advantages and drawbacks of Dependency Injection

#### Advantages
1. Logical Separation: Loose coupling between components and dependencies makes code easier to read and maintain. Classes do not manage dependency instantiation, leading to a clear separation of concerns.

2. Improved Testing: DI simplifies unit testing by making it easy to create mock dependencies. This allows for isolated and focused tests.

3. Flexible Dependency Management: Separating dependencies and components provides flexibility. Different dependencies can be injected, creating an easily adaptable environment.

4. Reusable Components: Loose coupling between components and dependencies enhances reusability. The same code can be reused in different contexts and environments.

5. Simpler Maintenance: Upgrading libraries or components does not affect the underlying dependent class. This eases maintenance and reduces the impact of changes.

6. Concurrent Development: Developers can work on modules and dependencies in parallel. This facilitates faster development by adhering to defined contracts.

#### Disadvantages
1. Complexity: Handling many dependencies or complex configurations increases code complexity. This can make the codebase harder to navigate and manage.

2. Learning Curve: Understanding DI concepts and best practices takes time. Initial project development may slow down due to this learning curve.

3. Overhead: DI adds unnecessary overhead in smaller projects. For simple applications, the added complexity might not be justified.

4. Runtime Errors: Misconfigured dependencies can lead to runtime errors. Troubleshooting these errors can be challenging, especially in complex environments.
